# SESSION POLICIES IN AMAZON EKS POD IDENTITY

Amazon EKS Pod Identity now supports Session Policies, allowing IAM permissions to be restricted for individual pods without creating multiple IAM roles.

## Key points to know

- Session Policies are inline IAM policies.
- Permissions are limited by the intersection of the IAM Role and the Session Policy.
- Session Policies can only reduce permissions.
- A single IAM Role can be shared across multiple workloads.
- Helps implement the Principle of Least Privilege.
- Supports both same-account and cross-account access.
- Reduces IAM Role management complexity.
- Can be configured using the AWS Console, CLI or SDK.

This feature makes Amazon EKS Pod Identity more secure, scalable and easier to manage in Kubernetes environments.
